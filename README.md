# The Hamler Programming Language

**Hamler** - Haskell-style functional programming language running on Erlang VM.

**Hamler** is a strongly-typed language with compile-time typechecking and built-in support for concurrency and distribution.

**Hamler** empowers industries to build the next generation of scalable, reliable, realtime applications, especially for 5G, IoT and edge computing.

## Why Hamler ?

For almost a decade, we have been developing software systems based on Erlang/OTP, especially our main product [EMQ X](https://github.com/emqx/emqx) - the scalable open-source MQTT broker. So, we have always believed that Erlang is a masterpiece of engineering. With amazing concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance, it is one of the few general-purpose language platforms able to properly handle concurrency and soft realtime.

However, from all the experience writing Erlang, we believe that the following features can help Erlang programmer better adapt to the coming wave of 5G, IoT and edge-programming and attract more people for using BEAM.

- Compile-time type checking and type reference
- ADTs, Function Composition, Type Classes
- More friendly syntax for prosperous communities
- Functor, Applicative and Monad...:)

Now all the features are avaliable in the Hamler programming language.

## Features

- Functional programming
- Haskell and ML style
- Compile-time type Checking/Inference
- Algebraic data type (ADT)
- Functions, higher-order functions
- Currying and partial application
- Pattern matching, and Guards
- List comprehension
- Applicative and Monad
- Advanced module system
- Built-in concurrency

## Design

The Hamler compiler architecture is shown as below:

![hamler-compiler](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamler-lang/hamler.github.io/master/images/compiler.png)

The Hamler 0.1 compiler was forked from [PureScript][PureScriptHamler] 0.13.6. The Hamler source code is parsed to generate **CST**, then CoreErlang's IR is generated after **CST -> AST -> CoreFn**'s syntax tree transformation, syntax analysis and type checking. The code is then used by the Erlang compiler to generate the final Beam bytecode.

```

## Build from source code

**Required**

+ [Erlang/OTP](erlang.org) >= 22
+ [Haskell Stack](haskellstack.org)

**Building**

1. Clone hamler from the git repo

   ```shell
   $ git clone https://github.com/hamler-lang/hamler.git
   $ cd hamler
   ```

2. Configuring

   ```shell
   $ export LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
   ```

3. Building

   ```shell
   $ make
   ```

4. Testing

   ```shell
   $ make test
   ```

5. Install hamler

   ```shell
   $ sudo make install
   ```

## Create a project

  ```shell
  $ mkdir demo-project
  $ cd demo-project
  $ hamler init
  $ make
  $ make run
  ```

## Try the interpreter

  ```shell
  $ hamler repl

  > -- List, range and enums
  > [1,2,3]
  > [1..10]
  > ['a'..'z']

  > -- erlang style maps
  > import Data.Map as Map
  > -- New map
  > m = #{"foo" => "bar", "bar" => "foo"}
  > -- Match Map
  > #{"foo" := a, "bar" := b} = m
  > -- get, put
  > Map.get "foo" m -- a = "bar"
  > Map.get "bar" m -- b = "foo"
  > m1 = Map.put "key" "val"
  > -- keys, values
  > keys = Map.keys m
  > values = Map.values m
  ```
