# Why Hamler?

For almost a decade, we have been developing software systems based on Erlang/OTP, especially our main product [EMQ X](https://github.com/emqx/emqx) - the scalable open-source MQTT broker. So, we have always believed that Erlang is a masterpiece of engineering. With amazing concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance, it is one of the few general-purpose language platforms able to properly handle concurrency and soft realtime.

However, from all the experience writing Erlang, we believe that the following features can help Erlang programmer better adapt to the coming wave of 5G, IoT and edge-programming and attract more people for using BEAM.

- Compile-time type checking and type reference
- ADTs, Function Composition, Type Classes
- More friendly syntax for prosperous communities
- Functor, Applicative and Monad...:)

Now all the features are avaliable in the Hamler programming language.
