# Why Hamler

**What's Hamler**

`Hamler`  A Haskell-style functional programming language running on Erlang VM. 

It is a strongly-typed language with compile-time typechecking and built-in support for concurrency and distribution. This makes it perfect for building the next generation of scalable, reliable, realtime applications, especially for 5G, IoT and edge computing.

Cool, let's quit the bragging and kick off.

So first of all, Hamler is functional. It is really similiar to Haskell.
